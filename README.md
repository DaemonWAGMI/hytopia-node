# HYTOPIA Full Node

This is a work in progress repository for running a full node on Mac or Linux operating systems.

## Quickstart (testnet)

Open your terminal

1. `git clone https://github.com/Topia-Game/hytopia-full-node.git`
1. `cd hytopia-full-node`
1. `sh run.sh testnet`

Your node should begin syncing with the HYTOPIA testnet chain. This can take a few hours or more.
