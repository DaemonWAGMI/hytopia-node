# HYTOPIA Node

This repository contains everything you need to run a HYTOPIA node on a linux or mac machine. Running a node helps support the HYTOPIA network.

## Quickstart (mainnet)

Open your terminal

1. `git clone https://github.com/Topia-Game/hytopia-node.git`
1. `cd hytopia-node`
1. `bash ./run.sh mainnet`

Your node should begin syncing with HYTOPIA Mainnet. This can take a few hours or more.

Once your node is synced, it will continue to run and contribute to the overall state, availability and resiliency of the network.
