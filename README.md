# HYTOPIA Node

This is a work in progress repository for running a node on Mac or Linux operating systems.

Open your terminal

1. `git clone https://github.com/Topia-Game/hytopia-node.git`
1. `cd hytopia-node`

Your node should begin syncing with HYTOPIA Mainnet. This can take a few hours or more.
